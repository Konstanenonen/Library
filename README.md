# Library App

## [Link to live preview](https://konstanenonen.github.io/Library/)

Library is a variation of todo-list app, that allows you to add boo cards to the app. This project was a tas for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) and the goal was to practise using javascript objects. The new book are made using book constructor function and that function's prototype property to practise prototypal inheritance. This project uses a lot of flexbox and grid layouts, because I want to practise those more and more.
